# Software Engineering Topics
Create a list of Software Engineering topics so that I can divide them among the 4 SE courses that we teach in our Software Development concentration.

The initial list comes from the list of topics in:
>*Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach*<br>
Roger S. Pressman and Bruce R. Maxim<br>
2015<br>
McGraw-Hill

*This list of topics is based on chapters in the book. The numbers will go away once I abandon the crutch of the book chapters...*
